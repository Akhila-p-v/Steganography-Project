Digital
● Though there are different possible methods available, we would go with digital steganography.

● In digital method the message is concealed within the lowest bits of images or sound files.

● The current project expects us to implement LSB (Least Significant Bit) Image Steganography on a .bmp files.

● This project expects us to Encode a message such a way that the quality of the image doesn't change much.

● So  we can do encoding of bits from the message in the LSB of the RGB data.
